This project is a Superset dashboard built using a social app user behavior dataset.
<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sexiaoze/stranger-social-app-user-behaviour-data?select=user_id.csv'>The dataset</a> was taken from Kaggle.

After some data preprocessing I created a dashboard using Apache Superset. You can find its jpeg and exported files in the repository. \
The dashboard contains DAU, WAU, MAU graphs, calculated ARPU, ARPPU, and total revenue metrics.
Also it contains line plots representing user behavior and a table of users, who bring most revenue. The table can be used to find people that are eligible to interact with for commercial purposes.
